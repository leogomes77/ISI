# Football Transfer ETL and Analysis Project
This project focuses on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) football transfer data. The main goal is to create a well-structured and normalized dataset from diverse raw data sources, which is then used for insightful analysis. The project will help identify patterns, trends, and metrics within the football transfer market, including player valuations, transfer fee trends, and club transfer strategies.
